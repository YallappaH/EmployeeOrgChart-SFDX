### How to Deploy:

1. Use the deployment script to push these UI updates to the Salesforce org:
   ```
   ./deploy-ui-update.sh
   ```

2. After deployment, administrators may need to use the `ClearUICache` Apex class to refresh the UI and see the changes:
   ```apex
   ClearUICache.refreshCache();
   ```

### Verification Steps:

1. After deployment, check the org chart to verify:
   * Indirect Labor department employees should have a darker grey left border
   * The background color should be a light grey (#F0F0F0)
   * Managers and LMTS employees should all display with the updated grey color scheme

### Additional Notes:

The color scheme now matches the requested configuration in the project tracking document, making Indirect Labor employees visually distinct from other departments.
